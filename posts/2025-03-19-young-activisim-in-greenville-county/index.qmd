### Young Activists of Greenville County: A Growing Movement

I started attending meetings with a local group of young activists in Greenville County, and after my second meeting, I wanted to write about what I’ve observed so far. From the meeeting organizers, it seems this group has experienced noticeable growth, largely fueled by a few well-placed posts on Reddit. That, and the super heated political climate lately.

The participants skews relatively young, mostly ranging from mid-20s to mid-30s, with some members in their upper 30s and early 40s. What’s immediately clear is the sense of community; there’s a strong appreciation for being among engaged (and like-minded) individuals who are passionate about shaping the future. The atmosphere is open, accepting, and thoughtful, and it’s refreshing to be in a space where people are courteous and engaged.

Just to give a hint of what this group is like; one of the major topics at this last meeting was structuring the organization for long-term sustainability. The group is working on formalizing membership processes, moving from appointed roles to elected ones, and drafting bylaws and charters. Right now, these discussions are still high-level, but leadership is keeping members informed as things progress. The sudden growth of the group has raised an important question: Is this momentum real and sustainable, or is it just a temporary spike? The next few meetings will be key in determining how this movement develops.

Leadership within the group is impressive. They are knowledgeable, well-versed in political strategy, and fluent in the language of activism. I find myself weighing long-term strategies against short-term gains, particularly in a challenging political time and place. It’s important to avoid repeating past mistakes while also making sure the decisions are made collectively through the developing structure of the organization. Watching the young minds at work makes me feel energized and happy to be there.

Meetings cover a range of important topics: upcoming events, advocacy initiatives, and campaign support for local candidates. Discussions include practical tools like the Five Calls app and Mobilize, as well as collaboration with other grassroots organizations. There are also conversations about policy initiatives such as the effort to save Paris Mountain from resort development. Members are actively learning how to engage with elected officials, attend city council meetings, and advocate for change at various levels of government.

Beyond political engagement, this group also does a lot of volunteer work, including litter pickups and other community service efforts. The fact that they are trying and growing means so much to me because you have to start somewhere. It reminds me of an old subreddit called *Just Start*, which encouraged people to begin blogging without waiting for perfection. That mindset applies here—if they don’t take action, then nothing will ever happen.

Another thing that stood out to me was how inclusive this group is. The diversity in the room was impressive and inspiring, especially in today’s climate. Every kind of person you can think of was there, representing different backgrounds, perspectives, and walks of life. Seeing that kind of representation in a space like this makes me hopeful for the future.

This is a movement that is still finding its footing, but it has real potential. The energy is there, and I’m looking forward to being part of its growth. If you’re in Greenville and looking for a way to get involved in community activism, this is definitely a space worth checking out.
