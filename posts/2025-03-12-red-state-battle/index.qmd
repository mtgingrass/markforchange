# Choose A Ticket

![](images/clipboard-811511245.png)

Running for Congress in a deep red district, you still have to choose a ticket. I‚Äôm running as a Democrat because I have to choose a ticket, but I‚Äôll represent everyone in this district, not just one party.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Narrative

Every election shapes the future. Even in areas where one party has historically dominated. Did you know our District Three used to be Democrat led for decades?

| Rep                   | Party      | Term Start  |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------|
| George Johnstone      | Democrat   | Mar 4, 1891 |
| Asbury C. Latimer     | Democrat   | Mar 4, 1893 |
| Wyatt Aiken           | Democrat   | Mar 4, 1903 |
| Frederick H. Dominick | Democrat   | Mar 4, 1917 |
| John C. Taylor        | Democrat   | Mar 4, 1933 |
| Butler B. Hare        | Democrat   | Jan 3, 1939 |
| W.J. Bryan Dorn       | Democrat   | Jan 3, 1947 |
| James Butler Hare     | Democrat   | Jan 3, 1949 |
| W.J. Bryan Dorn       | Democrat   | Jan 3, 1951 |
| Butler Derrick        | Democrat   | Jan 3, 1975 |
| Lindsey Graham        | Republican | Jan 3, 1995 |
| Gresham Barrett       | Republican | Jan 3, 2003 |
| Jeff Duncan           | Republican | Jan 3, 2011 |
| Sheri Biggs           | Republican | Jan 3, 2025 |

Party isn't what counts. What counts is building trust, broadening the conversation, and showing voters they have a choice.

Holding those in power accountable makes a difference. Every candidate (Republican, Democrat, or Independent), must engage with voters and prove they deserve to lead. That‚Äôs how democracy works best.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Giving a Voice

-   Many locals still feel unheard and don‚Äôt even bother voting. Running a serious campaign tells them:
    -   *‚ÄúYou are not alone.‚Äù*
    -   *‚ÄúYour vote matters.‚Äù*
    -   *‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building something bigger for the future.‚Äù*\
-   Inspires local Democrats & future candidates.
-   You might motivate others to run down-ballot (city councils, school boards, county commissions).\
-   Even if you don‚Äôt win, local races can flip sooner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Holding Republicans Accountable

-   Campaigning lets you challenge the GOP narrative.\
-   You force your opponent to answer hard questions in debates and public forums.\
-   Even a low-budget, grassroots campaign can control the conversation on key issues.\
-   **Exposes GOP weaknesses & corruption.**
    -   Even if you don‚Äôt win, your campaign could dig up issues that hurt the Republican long-term.\
    -   *Example:* If you expose a Republican‚Äôs bad policy or unethical behavior, it could damage their credibility for future races.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. A Platform to Push Important Issues

-   Even if you don‚Äôt win, you can shape public debate.
    -   *Example:* You can force healthcare, voting rights, or economic issues into the conversation in a way Republicans wouldn‚Äôt.\
-   If you run a strong campaign, you set the stage for future elections.\
-   Today‚Äôs ‚Äúunwinnable‚Äù races can become tomorrow‚Äôs battlegrounds.\
-   Your run could change how people see Democrats in your district.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Personal & Professional Benefits

-   **Builds Your Network.** You‚Äôll connect with activists, donors, media figures, and future political allies.\
-   **Establishes You as a Leader.** Even if you lose, running gives you credibility for future opportunities (another race, political advocacy, media, book deals, etc.).\
-   **Influences Future Policy.** You push issues into the mainstream and help shape your party‚Äôs platform.\
-   **Grows Your Public Speaking & Debate Skills.** These skills translate into any career.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Expanding the Voter Base & Data Collection

-   Running helps identify and register new Democratic voters.\
-   Even if you lose, the data from your campaign (voter engagement, issue polling, donation trends) helps the party refine future strategy.\
-   You can test messaging & outreach that might work better in future races.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Forces the Media to Cover Different Perspectives

-   The media loves a good underdog story.\
-   Even in a red state, you can control part of the media narrative just by running a smart, engaging campaign.\
-   Forces the local press to cover Democratic ideas, which are often ignored in red states.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Laying the Groundwork for a Future Run

-   Losing once doesn‚Äôt mean losing forever.\
-   **Beto O‚ÄôRourke** lost to Ted Cruz but made Texas more competitive.\
-   **Stacey Abrams** lost but flipped Georgia in 2020 through voter outreach.\
-   Running now builds name recognition for future races.\
-   Many successful politicians lost their first few elections before finally winning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Is It Worth It?

‚úî If your goal is to win immediately, running in a deep red district might seem pointless.\
‚úî But if your goal is to build a movement, push ideas, energize voters, and plant seeds for the future, then it absolutely has value.\
‚úî If you make progress this cycle, you (or another Democrat) will have a stronger foundation to run again next time.

üî• **Final Thought:** You don‚Äôt have to win to make a difference. You just have to show up and fight smart. üí™ Let‚Äôs get to work. üöÄ
