PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE_FILE

This is a placeholder file for the blog post thumbnail image. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual JPG image file that serves as the featured image for the blog post.

The image should be:
- Approximately 1200x600 pixels for optimal social media sharing
- Relevant to the blog post content
- High quality and professional looking
- Properly compressed for web use

To replace this placeholder:
1. Delete this text file
2. Add your actual JPG image with the same filename: placeholder-thumbnail.jpg
