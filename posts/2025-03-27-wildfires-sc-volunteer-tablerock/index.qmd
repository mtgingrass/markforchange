# **Help During the Table Rock Wildfires**

As wildfires continue to impact the Table Rock region, affecting both South Carolina and neighboring North Carolina communities, we must come together and support those on the front lines and those displaced by this crisis.

We must support our wildland firefighters, local volunteer fire departments, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), police officers, sheriff’s deputies, South Carolina Forestry Commission crews, and National Guard personnel who may be assisting with evacuations and logistics.

Here’s how you can help:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of **March 26, 2025**, the fire has consumed over **4,500 acres** with **0% containment**.

### 4. **Displaced Animals**

As evacuations continue, many families are being forced to leave their homes—and some cannot take their pets with them. Local shelters and volunteers are stepping in, but they’re overwhelmed.

**Here’s how you can help:**

-   **Foster a Pet:** If you have space, consider taking in a dog, cat, or other small pet for a few weeks while their family regroups. This provides enormous relief for both animals and owners.
-   **Donate Pet Supplies:** Drop off food, leashes, crates, bowls, and bedding to local animal shelters or supply collection sites.
-   **Volunteer for Animal Transport or Shelter Help:** Moving animals or helping care for them at temporary shelters is critical.
