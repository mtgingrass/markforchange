## My Vote

> “If I'm elected President, my first action will be launching an investigation into and prosecution of this administration at a scale not seen since Nuremberg.
>
> And if they are found guilty, there will be no pardons or reconciliation—only the harshest penalties applicable by law.
>
> For the international actors who aided and abetted them, there will be a complete embargo of trade, diplomacy, and aid until they are removed from office and delivered to the Hague to face justice.”

That is the Republican, Democrat, or Independt who has my vote.

## What Matters Now

The **only** thing that matters after this is making sure it can **never happen again**:

-   Court Reform\
-   Electoral College Reform\
-   Justice Reform

No more loopholes. No more escape routes. The system must be rebuilt to withstand corruption at the highest levels.
