## My Vote

> “If I'm elected President, my first action will be launching an investigation into and prosecution of this administration at a scale not seen since Nuremberg.
>
> And if they are found guilty, there will be no pardons or reconciliation—only the harshest penalties applicable by law.
>
> For the international actors who aided and abetted them, there will be a complete embargo of trade, diplomacy, and aid until they are removed from office and delivered to the Hague to face justice.”

That is the Democrat who has my vote.

## What Matters Now

The **only** thing that matters after this is making sure it can **never happen again**:

-   Court Reform\
-   Electoral College Reform\
-   Justice Reform

No more loopholes. No more escape routes. The system must be rebuilt to withstand corruption at the highest levels.
