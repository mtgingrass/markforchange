## Common Sense Starts with Conversation

Sometimes you rip the band-aid off. Sometimes you don’t.

But either way, we need to stop the division and start talking like neighbors again. This short video is just the beginning. It's a reminder that not every issue has a simple fix, but every issue deserves a real conversation.

**Let’s stop shouting and start listening.**

*Watch the short below and tell me—what’s an issue you think deserves more honest conversation in our community?*

```{=html}
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    html, body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      height: 100%;
    }
    body {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
    }
    /* Responsive iframe for 9:16 vertical aspect ratio */
    .video-container {
      position: relative;
      width: 100vw;         /* Full viewport width */
      height: 177.78vw;     /* 9:16 aspect ratio (height = width * 16/9) */
      max-height: 100vh;    /* Prevent from exceeding screen height */
      overflow: hidden;
    }
    .video-container iframe {
      position: absolute;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      border: 0;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io3_Wrf6hvk" 
            title="YouTube Short" 
            frameborder="0"
