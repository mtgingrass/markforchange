The time for playing defense is over. Democrats living in red states and red communities need to stop apologizing for existing and start taking what's theirs: political power at the local level.

## The Ground War Matters Most

While everyone obsesses over presidential elections and Senate races, the real battles that shape daily life happen in city council chambers and school board meetings. These positions control your property taxes, decide which books your kids can read, determine police budgets, and shape zoning laws that affect your neighborhood.

Republicans figured this out decades ago. They systematically captured school boards, city councils, and county commissions while Democrats focused on federal politics. The result? Even in purple areas, local government tilts hard right because Republicans showed up and Democrats stayed home.

## Stop Making Excuses

"It's too red here." "My vote doesn't matter." "I'll just keep my head down."

Bullshit.

Every red district has Democrats. They're your teachers, your doctors, your neighbors. They're tired of watching extremists run their communities into the ground. But someone has to give them something to vote for.

That someone is you.

## Take the Smaller Fights to Win the Bigger War

Running for city council isn't glamorous. School board meetings are brutal. But these positions have real power:

- City council controls development, police oversight, and local spending
- School boards shape curriculum and hire superintendents
- County commissioners oversee elections and budget decisions
- State legislature seats often go uncontested

When Democrats don't run, Republicans win by default. When moderate Republicans see organized Democratic opposition, they have to defend their positions instead of pushing extreme agendas.

## The Presence Strategy

You don't have to win to make a difference. Running forces conversations. It puts Democratic ideas into local media. It gives other Democrats someone to rally around.

One Democratic candidate on a five-person school board can expose bad decisions and force public debate. Two can build coalitions with moderate Republicans. Three can block harmful policies.

But zero means Republican extremists run unopposed.

## Fight for Your People

Red communities have plenty of people who need advocates: working families struggling with housing costs, parents fighting book bans, seniors on fixed incomes, young professionals who want good schools and infrastructure.

These voters exist in every community. They're looking for leaders who will fight for their interests instead of culture war nonsense.

## Be Bold, Not Polite

The old playbook of being "reasonable" and "bipartisan" doesn't work when the other side questions election results and bans books. 

Speak directly about what you'll do:
- "I'll vote against book bans"
- "I'll support affordable housing"
- "I'll push for transparent budgets"
- "I'll defend voting access"

Don't hedge. Don't equivocate. Say what you believe and why it matters to real people.

## The Long Game

Every Democrat elected to local office builds infrastructure for bigger fights. They develop name recognition, build donor lists, and create networks of supporters. Today's city council member becomes tomorrow's state representative.

More importantly, they prove Democratic governance works. They show voters that Democrats deliver results on bread-and-butter issues while Republicans fight culture wars.

## Start Now

Don't wait for the "right" election or the "perfect" district. Start attending city council meetings. Join local Democratic committees. Volunteer for existing candidates.

Then run yourself.

The bench stays empty until someone sits down. The fight stays lost until someone throws a punch.

Red states need Democratic fighters willing to take local power and use it. They need leaders who understand that politics is about power, and power unused is power surrendered.

Stop waiting for permission. Stop hoping someone else will do it. 

Take what you deserve: a voice in how your community is run.

Because if Democrats won't fight for Democratic voters in red territory, who will?
