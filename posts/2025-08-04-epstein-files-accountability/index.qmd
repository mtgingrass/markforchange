The recent Congressional battles over releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files have exposed a troubling reality: when it comes to protecting children and holding predators accountable, partisan politics too often gets in the way of justice.

## What Happened in Congress

In July 2025, House Democrats repeatedly attempted to force votes on releasing the Epstein files. The results were telling: 211 House Republicans voted to block the release, while all 212 Democrats supported transparency. Speaker Mike Johnson shut down the House floor to avoid the vote, pushing any decision until after the August recess.

This wasn't a partisan stunt. Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) partnered with Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky on a bipartisan resolution calling for the release of federal interview memos and evidence. As Khanna noted, they had secured support from about 12 Republicans who were willing to join all 212 Democrats in demanding transparency.

## The DOJ's Troubling Reversal

The situation became more concerning when the Justice Department announced on July 7, 2025, that no "client list" existed and that no further documents would be released. This directly contradicted Attorney General Pam Bondi's February statement to Fox News that such a list was "sitting on my desk right now to review."

The DOJ memo acknowledged there are more than 1,000 victims of Epstein's abuse. Yet rather than pursuing full transparency to identify all perpetrators, the department chose to close the door on further investigation, claiming it found "no credible evidence" that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals.

## Why This Matters

Sexual abuse of children transcends political affiliation. Whether the perpetrators are Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, or celebrities is irrelevant. What matters is that:

1. Over 1,000 victims deserve justice
2. Any adults who participated in or enabled these crimes should face accountability
3. The public has a right to know if powerful individuals used their influence to escape prosecution

The fact that only Democrats and a handful of Republicans support full transparency raises serious questions. If there's nothing to hide, why block the release? If protecting victims is the priority, why not redact their information while exposing the perpetrators?

## South Carolina's Role

Representative Sheri Biggs, who represents South Carolina's 3rd Congressional District, faces a clear choice. As one of only three women ever elected to Congress from South Carolina, she has an opportunity to stand up for the victims of sexual abuse. When Congress reconvenes, she should vote to release the files and support full transparency.

The voters of District 3 deserve to know whether their representative prioritizes protecting potential predators or protecting children. This isn't about partisan politics. It's about basic human decency and the rule of law.

## Moving Forward

Democrats in Congress have shown they're willing to force this issue repeatedly. They've used procedural tactics to make Republicans go on record opposing transparency. This strategy should continue until the files are released.

Every member of Congress, regardless of party, should ask themselves a simple question: What's more important, protecting powerful people who may have committed crimes against children, or getting justice for over 1,000 victims?

The answer should be obvious. Release the files. Investigate everyone named. Prosecute anyone who committed crimes. Party affiliation should never shield predators from accountability.

As citizens, we must demand better from our representatives. Contact your members of Congress. Tell them you support releasing the Epstein files. Tell them that protecting children matters more than protecting the powerful.

Because if we can't unite around stopping child sexual abuse, what does that say about us as a society?
