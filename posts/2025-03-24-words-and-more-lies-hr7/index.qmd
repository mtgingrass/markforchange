### What H.Res.7 Really Tells Us About Congress in South Carolina

Some resolutions in Congress are complete utter bullshit, but written with soft, compassionate language, invoking values we all care about: health, family, community, personal responsibility. Sherri Bigg's first bill, [House Resolution 7 (H.Res.7)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/7/text), appears to be one of those. It speaks about women’s healthcare, education, empowerment, and holistic support.

But scratch the surface, and a different picture emerges.

**The Language Sounds Good, but What’s Missing?**

H.Res.7 praises “Pro Women’s Healthcare Centers” (PWHCs) and calls for care that is:

- “Comprehensive” and “high-quality”
- Inclusive of “physical, mental, and spiritual wellness”
- Centered on women’s empowerment and family support


If that were the full story, this would be non-partisan and accepted by everyone. Who wouldn’t support better care for women?

But there’s a term repeated throughout the resolution that deserves attention: **“life-affirming.”** In this context, that phrase doesn’t mean support for life in a broad, moral sense. It has a specific political meaning: **opposition to abortion and contraception.**

I'd like to say that this langauge is embedded in the mission statements of the centers being praised, but the [website](www.pwhcenters.org) doesn't even exit. The whois [data](https://www.whois.com/whois/pwhcenters.com) about the website is private, too.

### **What Is This Resolution Actually Doing?**

**H.Res.7 is not a law**. It doesn’t allocate resources, mandate policy, or even propose a program. It’s a **public statement**, a symbolic gesture.

Inflation pressures families, Pickens and Anderson Country hospitals struggle, working parents juggle impossible schedules, Congress (Sherri Biggs) took time to… write a **press release** about a non-existent issue.

There’s no policy here. No action. Just affirmation of a specific ideology, dressed up as concerns for women.

And all of it paid for with taxpayer dollars and official letterhead. This is what we are paying for.

### **Why That Should Concern Everyone**

Conservative, liberal, independent, or something in between, this raises real questions about **how seriously our elected officials are doing their jobs**. Government efficiently, right? House of Representatives placeholder, if you ask me. A placeholder to cut and paste Washington's agenda. 

Even if you support the values behind the resolution, it’s worth asking:
         
- Why spend time and taxpayer dollars to write a symbolic statement instead of crafting real legislation?
- Why introduce something that **doesn’t change anything**, yet frames itself as meaningful action?

I guess this is practice for saying *yes* to more important issues that Washington tells her to say yes to. You can tell this was handed to her by her staff to sign. Again, just a placeholder for saying *yes* to everything that comes down from the top. 

### **Leadership, Not Lip Service**

Representatives are elected to bring solutions, not ads in newspapers. Submiting bologne documents instead of policy is nothing more than a con artist selling bull shit to the public. That's all we need, one of the 435 members of the House to be a placeholder, not standing up for South Carolina distrcit three. 

If a member of Congress wants to promote better healthcare access, let them do the hard work of **legislating**, not issuing endorsements wrapped in legislative cut and paste language.

### **H.Res.7 isn’t governance**

And in a time when Real Americans are looking for accountability, rising above the con artist propaganda, and practical solutions to everyday problems, **branding isn’t enough**. Not to mention the staff did all the work, paid for by your tax dollars. What has she actually done besides sign documents her staff provided her?
