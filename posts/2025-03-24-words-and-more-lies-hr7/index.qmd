### What H.Res.7 Really Tells Us About Congress in South Carolina

Some resolutions in Congress are complete utter bullshit, but written with soft, compassionate language, invoking values we all care about: health, family, community, personal responsibility. Sherri Bigg's first bill, [House Resolution 7 (H.Res.7)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-resolution/7/text), appears to be one of those. It speaks about women’s healthcare, education, empowerment, and holistic support.

But scratch the surface, and a different picture emerges.

**The Language Sounds Good, but What’s Missing?**

H.Res.7 praises “Pro Women’s Healthcare Centers” (PWHCs) and calls for care that is:

```         
•   “Comprehensive” and “high-quality”
•   Inclusive of “physical, mental, and spiritual wellness”
•   Centered on women’s empowerment and family support
```

If that were the full story, this would be non-partisan and accepted by everyone. Who wouldn’t support better care for women?

But there’s a term repeated throughout the resolution that deserves attention: **“life-affirming.”** In this context, that phrase doesn’t mean support for life in a broad, moral sense. It has a specific political meaning: **opposition to abortion and contraception.**

I'd lovet to say that this langauge is embedded in the mission statements of the centers being praised, but the [website](www.pwhcenters.org) doesn't even exit. The whois [data](https://www.whois.com/whois/pwhcenters.com) about the website is private, too.

### **What Is This Resolution Actually Doing?**

**H.Res.7 is not a law**. It doesn’t allocate resources, mandate policy, or even propose a program. It’s a **public statement**, a symbolic gesture.

Inflation pressures families, Pickens and Anderson Country hospitals struggle, working parents juggle impossible schedules, Congress (Sherri Biggs) took time to… write a **press release** about a non-existent issue.

There’s no policy here. No action. Just affirmation of a specific ideology, dressed up as concerns for women.

And all of it paid for with taxpayer dollars and official letterhead. This is what we are paying for.

### **Why That Should Concern Everyone**

Conservative, liberal, independent, or something in between, this raises real questions about **how seriously our elected officials are doing their jobs**. Government efficiently, right?

Even if you support the values behind the resolution, it’s worth asking:

```         
•   Why spend time and taxpayer funding to write a symbolic statement instead of crafting real legislation?
•   Why use Congress to elevate a specific network of politically affiliated health centers while ignoring broader public health needs?
•   Why introduce something that **doesn’t change anything**, yet frames itself as meaningful action?
```

This isn’t about values, it’s about **priorities**.

### **Leadership, Not Lip Service**

Representatives are elected to bring solutions to the table. Submiting symbolic documents instead of policy proposals is nothing more than a con artist selling bull shit to the public.

If a member of Congress wants to promote better healthcare access, let them propose **funding**, **oversight**, or data collection. Let them do the hard work of **legislating**, not issuing endorsements wrapped in legislative cut and paste language.

### **H.Res.7 isn’t governance**

And in a time when Americans are looking for accountability, rising above partisan bickering, and practical solutions to everyday problems, **branding isn’t enough**. Not to mention the staff did all the work, paid for by your tax dollars.
