# Running in a Deep Red District

Too often, elections turn into red vs. blue. But here in Distrcit Three, we know that our values don’t fit into party boxes. If I choose to run, I would run as a Democrat, but my focus is on **common-sense solutions** that work for our communities, not political games.

Every election matters. Even when winning seems unlikely, running in a deep red district as a Democrat serves a larger purpose that can only be realized for future generations to come.

## **Momentum for the Future**

Every campaign is a step forward. Even if a Democrat doesn’t win in 2026, closing the gap signals growth and forces Republicans to work harder to hold onto their seats in future elections. History has shown that places once considered deep red—like parts of Georgia, Arizona, and Texas—became competitive over time. Why? Because people showed up, organized, and fought for representation.

## Change Doesn’t Happen Overnight

A strong showing, even in a loss, can lay the groundwork for future candidates to gain traction in a long-term strategy to make elections more competitive and make every voice is heard.

### Georgia's Transformation

Take Georgia, for example. For years, one side lost election after election. But instead of giving up, they worked to **increase voter engagement, register new voters, and change the conversation.** By the time the 2020 election arrived, Georgia flipped for the first time in decades. That didn't happen by accident—it happened because voters kept showing up, even when it seemed unwinnable.

## Holding Sherri Biggs Accountable  

A strong challenge means Sherri Biggs can’t coast to victory. Even in races where the odds seem stacked, making an incumbent campaign, debate, and answer to the people forces them to defend their record instead of relying on party loyalty.  

Ask the tough questions. Make her explain where she stands on fixing our roads and bridges, what she’s doing to lower healthcare costs, and how she’s ensuring schools get the funding they need. Ask her how she’s defending the federal workforce. I’ll tell you what response you’ll get: “I believe in Trump’s plan 100%, and whatever he wants, goes.” In other words, a yes-woman—no pushback, no guts.

This kind of pressure forces Sherri and her allies to spend time, money, and effort defending a seat they assumed was safe. Every dollar spent protecting a weak record here is a dollar they can’t use to push their agenda elsewhere.

## Beyond Party Lines

Most voters aren’t as extreme as their party’s loudest voices. Many voters (independents, too) feel disconnected from politics and don’t align with either side. 

Many voters vote Republican not because they love their candidate, but because they don’t think they have another option. A Democrat who shows up, listens, and speaks in common sense terms can earn votes  by proving they are an **independent thinker**, not a party puppet.

When candidates speak about issues rather than labels, they break through partisan barriers. Instead of saying:\
*“We need progressive economic policies,”*\
Try:\
*“We need an economy where small businesses thrive and workers aren’t crushed by healthcare costs.”*

Framing issues in terms that resonate locally rather than through ideological jargon is key to making inroads with all voters.

## **Mobilizing Non-Voters**

The biggest untapped voter base isn’t die-hard Republicans or Democrats; it’s the **people who don’t vote at all.** Many feel disillusioned, thinking their voice doesn’t matter. But when a candidate speaks directly to them, fights for their issues, and shows up where others don’t, it can reignites the belief in the power of voting. So, how do we get them to vote? We are going to try and find out. 

**Local Impact:** If just 10% of non-voters show up to vote for an alternative candidate, the entire race dynamic changes. It forces a shift in priorities, strategies, and policies from both sides.

Campaigns that focus only on flipping Republican voters miss the bigger opportunity. Instead, focus on energizing people who feel ignored by both parties; low-income workers, younger voters, minorities, and communities with low turnout. Many aren’t loyal to a party, but they will back someone who listens and fights for them.

## Set the Stage

When someone steps up to challenge the status quo, they pave the way for future candidates. It could be the next cycle or years down the road. **Running and losing isn’t failure.** It’s part of a longer fight to shift the political landscape, build trust, and plant the seeds for future victories.

Many first-time challengers don’t win, but they start conversations, introduce ideas, and shift political expectations. The more normal it becomes for strong opposing candidates to run in red districts, the more viable the chances to win becomes over time.

**Long-Term Strategy:** Even if I don’t win, the race gives future candidates:\
✅ **Data on where support is strongest**\
✅ **Experience building grassroots movements**\
✅ **A stronger local paaty presence**\
✅ **Newly engaged voters who now believe change is possible**

## **Win or Lose, It’s Worth It**

This possible campaign isn’t about winning a seat, it’s about momentum. Every conversation, debate, and vote cast moves the district forward. **Let's force the opposition to defend her stance. Let's mobilize people who have been ignored, and lay the groundwork for real change.**

If no one runs, no one challenges the status quo. But if people step up, speak out, and organize, the political landscape can shift in ways no one expected.
