# Mark for Change

## **Real-World Solutions**

I believe in practical leadership—leadership with action, and delivering results. My career has been built on efficiency, accountability, and problem-solving. I've been handling multi-million dollar contracts, cutting through bureaucracy, and making sure that taxpayer money is spent wisely for the past two decades.

I’m ready to bring that same level of commitment to my community—fighting for smart policies, responsible budgeting, and solutions that actually work.

## **A Problem Solver**
I’m **Mark Gingrass**, a technical leader, project manager, and government contracting expert with over 20 years of experience in the federal sector. I’ve spent my career making sure that large-scale projects are delivered, executed on time, on budget, and with real impact. 

Success in this space requires more than just expertise, it takes the ability to navigate bureaucracy, manage resources wisely, and embrace technology. That’s where I excel:

- **Budgeting & Cost Management** – I know how to make every dollar count.
- **Cutting Through Bureaucracy** – I’ve worked across multiple complex government agencies.
- **Technology & Innovation** – I understand how modern solutions can drive efficiency and improve government services.

I’m not a career politician. I’m a **problem solver**, and I know that real leadership is about taking action, not making empty promises.

## **Representing Everyone**

I believe in policies that make sense, not ones that are burdened by inefficiency, waste, or outdated thinking.

### **What I Stand For**

- **Smart Budgeting & Fiscal Responsibility** – I have spent years managing large-scale budgets in the federal space. I know how to stretch a dollar and make sure funds are allocated where they matter most.  

- **Government Accountability & Efficiency** – I believe in transparency and measurable results. Bureaucracy shouldn’t be a barrier to progress—it should be optimized to serve the community.  

- **Stronger Communities & Infrastructure** – As an avid hiker, weekend vanlifer, and outdoor enthusiast, I care deeply about preserving public lands, improving transportation, and maintaining local services.  

- **Innovation & Modernization** – I understand **technology, policy, and governance**, and I know how to **bring them together to create better solutions** for the community.  

- **A Voice for Everyone** – Politics shouldn't be about division—it should be about practical solutions that serve all citizens. I will work to make sure everyone has a voice, regardless of political background.

## **Real-World Expertise**

I didn’t start my career in politics, I built it **solving real problems**. As a Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), I’ve been responsible for managing multi-million dollar projects, negotiating contracts, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are used efficiently.  

I know what works and what doesn’t inside government, and I know how to fix broken processes. I’ve seen firsthand what effective leadership looks like.  

I also understand people, not just spreadsheets. I’ve spent years building relationships with stakeholders at all levels, from top executives to front-line employees. I know that real solutions come from **listening to the community** and finding common ground.

## **Advocate for the Outdoors**

I believe that strong communities are built on shared experiences, and I live by that philosophy. 

### **Outdoor Enthusiast**

I spend my free time hiking, mountain biking, and traveling with my dog, Ollie. I’ve explored some of the toughest trails and understand the importance of preserving our public lands, improving outdoor access, and investing in local infrastructure.

### **A Curious Mind**  

I’m  interested in Lean Thinking, Six Sigma, and government efficiency. I’ve studied how wasteful policies harm our economy and how we can fix them with data-driven solutions.

At the end of the day, I **don’t just talk about change, I make it happen**.
