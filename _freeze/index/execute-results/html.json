And I’m coming for your position, **Sheri Biggs**.\n\n::: callout-warning\nSheri Biggs isn’t a leader; she’s a copy-paste artist. When I reached out with real concerns, she didn’t answer me. She sent back a **pre-written, party-approved script**. That’s not leadership. That’s being a yes-woman to the administration **instead of thinking** for the people she was elected to represent.\n:::\n\nI grew up on the streets. I grew up poor. I traveled. I worked my way up from a McDonald’s job and a paper route to enlisted service in the Air Force, climbing the blue, then white-collar ladders and stepping into senior management and leadership.\n\nI’m done with bipartisan politics, and you should be done, too. **Done with the BS.** Done with empty buzzwords, and empty promises. We don't need to pay you for spitting out buzzwords pre-scripted. We need to pay for action and critical thinking, not running around like a sheep.\n\nI’m the real deal.\n\n## **You Want Authenticity? You’re Looking at It.**\n\nWhen I speak, it won’t be pre-packaged, sanitized, or scripted. I don’t care if you’re far right, far left, or in the middle. I don’t care. What you’ll get from me are real, data-driven, common-sense answers.\n\nHere’s the truth:\n\nEveryone in this community wants the same things—we just speak different languages.\n\n-   We want a **better life**.\n-   We want what we’ve **earned**.\n-   We don’t want **handouts**,\n-   but we do care about **people who need a lift**.\n\n**We want that support vetted, audited, and spent where it belongs.**\n\n## **Our Values Aren’t the Problem. The Noise Is.**\n\nI believe everyone has passion. I believe everyone has empathy. I believe in getting results. The problem isn’t what we stand for, it’s how we express it.\n\nThat’s where the division starts.\n\n## **You Want a Leader? Here’s What I’ll Do.**\n\nVote for me because I stand for being **real, pragmatic, and relentless**. I’ll work hard so everyone can rise up.\n\n-   No cookie-cutter responses.\n-   No canned statements.\n-   No “yes-man” politics.\n\nMy process is simple:\n\n-   **Find out what my constituents want.**\n-   **Identify what they don’t know and help them understand.**\n-   **Learn what I don’t know and educate myself.**\n-   **Dig deep, analyze the data, and make the right decisions.**\n-   **Act quickly, efficiently, and boldly.**\n\n## **We Can Cut the Waste Without Cutting People Down.**\n\nWe can *rip off the band-aid*, but we’re not here to burn the house down in the process. We need real solutions, not just slogans.\n\n**Equality isn’t about lowering standards; it’s about lifting people up.**\n\n## **This Is Our Fight.**\n\nThe middle class is strong. We fight for what we’ve earned. We don’t hate the poor. We don’t want division. We want to **rise together** effectively, meaningfully, and without waste.\n\n-   This is our community.\n-   And I believe in it.\n-   **No fluff. No nonsense. No bull.**\n\n## **You Want Real Change? You Want a Leader?**\n\nIf you want a leader, not another **cut-and-paste politician**. Not a **yes-man**.\n\nThen **vote for me, Mark Gingrass**\n\n## **Sheri Biggs, I’m taking your job.**\n\nStep by step, we’re making a difference. Whether it’s me or someone else along the way, we’re working our way up—and we’re not stopping until we take your job.\n\n",
