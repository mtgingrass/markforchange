# **From Enlisted to the Hill, to SC District 3**

**1. Strategic Defense with Operational Depth**

Four years in the **U.S. Air Force** working on **B-1 bombers** taught Mark more than electronics, it taught him **systems thinking**, national security priorities, and how global force projection works from the ground up. He learned how mission success depends on aligning parts, people, and purpose.

> *He knows what it means to work at the intersection of frontline readiness and strategic defense.*

**2. Supply Chain and Logistics Expertise**

At **Tinker Air Force Base**, Mark moved from component-level work to **enterprise-level logistics and depot operations**. He gained a top-down understanding of how government sustains readiness: procurement, asset visibility, lifecycle management, and compliance with DoD directives and the Art of the Possible. Mark managed **multi-billion-dollar programs** and enterprise systems.

> *That’s the kind of thinking Congress desperately needs when talking about budgets, military spending, and efficiency. He didn’t inherit leadership; he earned it by optimizing broken systems and guiding teams through change.*

**3. Leading Teams & Restructuring Organizations**

Whether in uniform or in a suit, Mark has **led cross-functional teams** of specialists, engineers, and analysts - **reorganizing processes, aligning workflows**, and unlocking performance. He’s managed technical staff, engineers, scientists, contractors, and brought clarity where confusion reigned.

> *Leadership isn’t about command, it’s about building trust, driving change, and getting results.*

**4. Data, Procurement & AI Policy at the FDA**

Mark led projects at the **intersection of data, policy, and innovation**, bringing modern tools like **AI** into government workflows, managing contractors, navigating **federal acquisition regulations (FAR)**, and **compliance without bureaucracy getting in the way of progress**.

> *He knows how to modernize agencies from the inside out.*

**5. Holistic Governance Experience**

From Air Force logistics to FDA acquisitions, Mark’s worked across **multiple federal agencies**, understanding both the **front lines** and the **systems that support them**. He’s used to **reading policy, writing directives**, and holding vendors accountable—all skills of a great legislator.
