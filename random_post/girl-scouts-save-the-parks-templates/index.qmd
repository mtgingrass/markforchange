## Future Generations

**Subject:** Protect South Carolina’s State Forests – Our Future Depends on It

**Dear \[Representative’s Name\],**

As a South Carolinian, I take great pride in our beautiful forests, parks, and public lands. They are more than just scenic landscapes—they are vital to our environment, our economy, and our way of life. **Our state forests deserve to be fully funded, fully staffed, and fully protected for future generations.**

Recently, we have seen troubling changes at the **federal level** that put national forests at risk. South Carolina should not follow this example. Instead, **we should set the standard for conservation, responsible land management, and long-term sustainability.**

Our forests provide:\
✅ **Clean air & water** for all South Carolinians\
✅ **Habitat for wildlife** and protection of endangered species\
✅ **Outdoor recreation** that supports local businesses\
✅ **A legacy for future generations** of Girl Scouts, families, and nature lovers

I urge you to advocate for **full staffing, proper funding, and strong conservation policies** to keep our forests thriving. The federal government may be making choices that threaten national forests, but **we have the power to protect South Carolina’s lands and set the right example.**

Please stand with us in preserving South Carolina’s forests and public lands.

**Sincerely,**\
\[Your Name\]\
\[City, SC\]\

## A State-Led Approach

**Subject:** Support South Carolina’s Forests – Oppose Harmful Federal Policies

**Dear \[Representative’s Name\],**

I am writing to express my strong support for preserving and protecting **South Carolina’s state forests and public lands.** As a member of this community, I know how much these natural spaces mean to our state.

Recently, the **federal government has moved in a direction that threatens the sustainability of national forests.** South Carolina **must take an independent approach** to ensure our forests remain protected, well-managed, and fully staffed.

### **Key concerns:**

-   **Federal policies risk undermining conservation efforts** that keep our forests healthy and thriving.\
-   **Reduced funding and staffing** would leave our parks vulnerable to mismanagement and degradation.\
-   **South Carolina’s forests should be managed based on our state’s needs, not one-size-fits-all federal policies.**

### **I urge you to:**

-   **Ensure full funding & staffing** for state forest management\
-   **Reject federal-style policies** that weaken conservation efforts\
-   **Support local decision-making** that reflects the needs of South Carolinians

South Carolina’s forests belong to us. **Let’s lead by example and show the federal government how to do conservation the right way.**

**Sincerely,**\
\[Your Name\]\
\[City, SC\]\
