## Conservation Leader

**Subject:** Keep South Carolina a Conservation Leader – Continue Investing in Our State Parks  

**Dear [Representative’s Name],**  

I want to take a moment to **thank you and South Carolina’s leadership** for the ongoing efforts to **protect, expand, and invest in our state parks**. It’s encouraging to see the commitment to preserving our forests and ensuring they remain fully staffed, accessible, and thriving for generations to come.  

South Carolina has **set an example for the nation** with initiatives like:

- The **proposed $18 million investment** to open four new state parks in 2025  
- Expanding our park system by **more than 10% in the last five years**  
- Securing essential funding to **support conservation efforts and recreation**  

In a time when **federal policies threaten national forests**, it is critical that **South Carolina continues to lead in responsible land management**. These parks provide not only natural beauty but also economic growth, tourism, and recreational opportunities that benefit all South Carolinians.  

I urge you to **maintain this strong commitment** by:

- **Ensuring full funding and staffing** for our parks and forest services  
- **Continuing to expand and protect** our public lands  
- **Opposing any future policies that could weaken conservation efforts**  

South Carolina’s forests are **one of our greatest assets**, and I am proud to see our state leading the way. Let’s keep setting the standard for environmental stewardship and economic sustainability.  

**Sincerely,**  
[Your Name]

## Future Generations

**Subject:** Protect South Carolina’s State Forests – Our Future Depends on It

**Dear \[Representative’s Name\],**

As a South Carolinian, I take great pride in our beautiful forests, parks, and public lands. They are more than just scenic landscapes—they are vital to our environment, our economy, and our way of life. **Our state forests deserve to be fully funded, fully staffed, and fully protected for future generations.**

Recently, we have seen troubling changes at the **federal level** that put national forests at risk. South Carolina should not follow this example. Instead, **we should set the standard for conservation, responsible land management, and long-term sustainability.**

Our forests provide:\
✅ **Clean air & water** for all South Carolinians\
✅ **Habitat for wildlife** and protection of endangered species\
✅ **Outdoor recreation** that supports local businesses\
✅ **A legacy for future generations** of Girl Scouts, families, and nature lovers

I urge you to advocate for **full staffing, proper funding, and strong conservation policies** to keep our forests thriving. The federal government may be making choices that threaten national forests, but **we have the power to protect South Carolina’s lands and set the right example.**

Please stand with us in preserving South Carolina’s forests and public lands.

**Sincerely,**\
\[Your Name\]\
\[City, SC\]\
\[Optional: Affiliation with Girl Scouts, Community Group, etc.\]

## A State-Led Approach

**Subject:** Support South Carolina’s Forests – Oppose Harmful Federal Policies

**Dear \[Representative’s Name\],**

I am writing to express my strong support for preserving and protecting **South Carolina’s state forests and public lands.** As a member of this community, I know how much these natural spaces mean to our state.

Recently, the **federal government has moved in a direction that threatens the sustainability of national forests.** South Carolina **must take an independent approach** to ensure our forests remain protected, well-managed, and fully staffed.

### **Key concerns:**

-   **Federal policies risk undermining conservation efforts** that keep our forests healthy and thriving.\
-   **Reduced funding and staffing** would leave our parks vulnerable to mismanagement and degradation.\
-   **South Carolina’s forests should be managed based on our state’s needs, not one-size-fits-all federal policies.**

### **I urge you to:**

-   **Ensure full funding & staffing** for state forest management\
-   **Reject federal-style policies** that weaken conservation efforts\
-   **Support local decision-making** that reflects the needs of South Carolinians

South Carolina’s forests belong to us. **Let’s lead by example and show the federal government how to do conservation the right way.**

**Sincerely,**\
\[Your Name\]\
\[City, SC\]\
