# Mark for Change

# **Sheri, Copy-Paste Politics Won’t Save You in 26'.**

Mark Gingrass brings a background in computer science, a master’s in business, and a PhD in real-world experience. He believes that public service is about listening, learning, and leading. The district deserves leadership that prioritizes people, fosters real conversations, and delivers meaningful action—something he is committed to bringing to the table.

::: callout-warning
Sheri Biggs isn’t a leader; she’s a copy-paste artist. When I reached out with real concerns, she didn’t answer me. She sent back a **pre-written, party-approved script**. That’s not leadership. That’s being a yes-woman to the administration **instead of thinking** for the people she was elected to represent.
:::

Mark Gingrass came from humble beginnings, growing up in challenging circumstances and working tirelessly to build a better future. He started with jobs at McDonald’s and a paper route, later enlisting in the U.S. Air Force. Through dedication and perseverance, he advanced from enlisted service to leadership roles, climbing both blue- and white-collar career ladders to senior management. His journey reflects a commitment to hard work, resilience, and continuous growth.

We are done with bipartisan politics, and you should be done, too. **Done with the BS.** Done with empty buzzwords, and empty promises. We don't need to pay you for spitting out buzzwords pre-scripted. We need to pay for action and critical thinking, not running around like a sheep.

Mark is the real deal.

## **You Want Authenticity? You’re Looking at It.**

When Mark speaks, it won’t be pre-packaged, sanitized, or scripted. He won't care if you’re far right, far left, or in the middle. What you’ll get from Mark Gingrass are real, data-driven, common-sense answers.

Here’s the truth:

Everyone in this community wants the same things—we just speak different languages.

-   We want a **better life**.
-   We want what we’ve **earned**.
-   We don’t want **handouts**,
-   but We do care about **people who need a lift**.

**We want that support vetted, audited, and spent where it belongs.**

## **Our Values Aren’t the Problem. The Noise Is.**

Mark believes everyone has passion. He believe everyone has empathy. He believes in getting results. The problem isn’t what we stand for, it’s how we express it.

That’s where the division starts.

## **You Want a Leader? Here’s What Mark Gingrass Will Do.**

Vote for Mark because he stands for being **real, pragmatic, and relentless**. He will work hard so **everyone** can rise.

-   No cookie-cutter responses.
-   No canned statements.
-   No “yes-man” politics.

Mark's process is simple:

-   **Find out what the constituents want.**
-   **Identify what they don’t know and help them understand.**
-   **Relentlessly educate himself**
-   **Dig deep, analyze the data, and make the right decisions.**
-   **Act quickly, efficiently, and boldly.**

## **We Can Cut the Waste Without Cutting People Down.**

We can *rip off the band-aid*, but we’re not here to burn the house down in the process. We need real solutions, not just slogans.

**Equality isn’t about lowering standards; it’s about lifting people up.**

## **This Is Our Fight.**

The middle class is strong. We fight for what we’ve earned. We don’t hate the poor. We don’t want division. We want to **rise together** effectively, meaningfully, and without waste.

-   This is our community.
-   And Mark believes in it.
-   **No fluff. No nonsense. No bull.**

## **You Want Real Change? You Want a Leader?**

If you want a leader, not another **cut-and-paste politician**. Not a **yes-man**.

Then **support Mark Gingrass**

## **Sheri Biggs, it’s time for real leadership. If you won’t step up, we will.**

Step by step, we’re making a difference. Whether it’s Mark or someone else along the way, we’re working our way up—and we’re not stopping until we hold you accountable.
