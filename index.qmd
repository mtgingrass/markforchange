# Mark for Change

# **Sherry Biggs, Pack Your Bags—Your Time Is Up Before You Even Started.**

I have a background in **computer engineering**, a **master’s in business**, and a **PhD in street smarts**. And I’m coming for your position, **Sherry Biggs**.

I grew up on the streets. I grew up poor. I worked my way up—from a **McDonald’s job and a paper route** to **enlisted service in the Air Force**, climbing the **blue-collar ladder** and stepping into **management and leadership**.

I’m **done** with bipartisan politics. **Done** with the BS. **Done** with empty buzzwords.

I’m the **real deal**.

## **You Want Authenticity? You’re Looking at It.**

When I speak, it won’t be **pre-packaged, sanitized, or scripted**. I don’t care if you’re far right, far left, or in the middle—I **don’t care**. What you’ll get from me are **real, data-driven, common-sense answers**.

Here’s the truth:

Everyone in this community wants the same things—we just speak **different languages**.

-   We want a **better life**.
-   We want what we’ve **earned**.
-   We don’t want **handouts**,
-   but we do care about **people who need a lift**.

**We want that support vetted, audited, and spent where it belongs.**

## **Our Values Aren’t the Problem—The Noise Is.**

I believe in **passion**. I believe in **empathy**. I believe in **results**.\
The problem isn’t what we stand for—it’s **how we express it**.

That’s where the division starts.

## **You Want a Leader? Here’s What I’ll Do.**

Vote for me because I stand for being **real, pragmatic, and relentless**. I’ll work hard so everyone can **rise up**.

No cookie-cutter responses.\
No canned statements.\
No “yes-man” politics.

My process is simple:

-   **Find out what my constituents want.**\
-   **Identify what they don’t know and help them understand.**\
-   **Learn what I don’t know and educate myself.**\
-   **Dig deep, analyze the data, and make the right decisions.**\
-   **Act quickly, efficiently, and boldly.**

## **We Can Cut the Waste Without Cutting People Down.**

We can **rip off the band-aid**, but we’re not here to burn the house down in the process.\
We need **real solutions**, not just **slogans**.

**Equality isn’t about lowering standards; it’s about lifting people up.**

## **This Is Our Fight.**

The **middle class** is strong. We fight for what we’ve **earned**.\
We don’t hate the poor.\
We don’t want division.\
We want to **rise together**—effectively, meaningfully, and without waste.

This is our **community**.\
And I believe in it.\
**No fluff. No nonsense. No bull.**

## **You Want Real Change? You Want a Leader?**

Not another **cut-and-paste politician**.\
Not a **yes-man**.

Then **vote for me.**

**Sherry Biggs, I’m coming for your job in 2028.**
