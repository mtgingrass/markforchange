# Mark for Change

## **Leadership, Accountability, and Real-World Solutions**

I believe in practical leadership—leadership with action, and delivering results. My career has been built on efficiency, accountability, and problem-solving. I've been handling multi-million dollar contracts, cutting through bureaucracy, and making sure that taxpayer money is spent wisely for the past two decades.

I’m ready to bring that same level of commitment to my community—fighting for smart policies, responsible budgeting, and solutions that actually work.

## **About Me: A Problem Solver for the People**
I’m **Mark Gingrass**, a technical leader, project manager, and government contracting expert with over 20 years of experience in the federal sector. I’ve spent my career making sure that large-scale projects are delivered, executed on time, on budget, and with real impact. 

I specialize in:
- **Budgeting & Cost Management** – I know how to make every dollar count.
- **Cutting Through Bureaucracy** – I’ve worked across multiple complex government agencies.
- **Technology & Innovation** – I understand how modern solutions can drive efficiency and improve government services.

I’m not a career politician. I’m a **problem solver**—and I know that real leadership is about taking action, not making empty promises.

## **A Leader Who Represents Everyone**

**Innovation & Modernization** – I understand **technology, policy, and governance**, and I know how to **bring them together to create better solutions** for the community.

## **My Background: Bringing Real-World Expertise to Government**
I didn’t start my career in politics—I built it **solving real problems**. As a **Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR)** for the **FDA**, I’ve been responsible for **managing multi-million dollar projects, negotiating contracts, and ensuring taxpayer dollars are used efficiently**.  

I know what **works and what doesn’t** inside government, and I know how to **fix broken processes**. Whether it's managing **workflow automation, modernizing outdated systems, or leading major technical initiatives**, I’ve seen firsthand what **effective leadership** looks like.  

I also **understand people**—not just spreadsheets. I’ve spent years **building relationships with stakeholders** at all levels, from top executives to front-line employees. I know that real solutions come from **listening to the community** and **finding common ground**.

## **Beyond Work: A True Advocate for the Outdoors & Community**
I believe that **strong communities are built on shared experiences**—and I live by that philosophy.  
### **Outdoor Enthusiast & Conservation Advocate**  
I spend my free time **hiking, mountain biking, and traveling with my dog, Ollie**. I’ve explored **some of the toughest trails** and understand the importance of **preserving our public lands, improving outdoor access, and investing in local infrastructure**.

### **A Curious Mind & A Problem Solver**  
I’m deeply interested in **Lean Thinking, Six Sigma, and government efficiency**. I’ve studied how **wasteful policies** harm our economy and how **we can fix them** with **data-driven solutions**.

At the end of the day, I **don’t just talk about change—I make it happen**.
