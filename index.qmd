# Mark for Change

# **Sheri, Copy-Paste Politics Won’t Save You in 26'.**

I have a background in computer science, a master’s in business, and a **PhD in street smarts**. And I’m coming for your position, **Sheri Biggs**.

::: callout-warning
Sheri Biggs isn’t a leader; she’s a copy-paste artist. When I reached out with real concerns, she didn’t answer me. She sent back a **pre-written, party-approved script**. That’s not leadership. That’s being a yes-woman to the administration **instead of thinking** for the people she was elected to represent.
:::

I grew up on the streets. I grew up poor. I traveled. I worked my way up from a McDonald’s job and a paper route to enlisted service in the Air Force, climbing the blue, then white-collar ladders and stepping into senior management and leadership.

I’m done with bipartisan politics, and you should be done, too. **Done with the BS.** Done with empty buzzwords, and empty promises. We don't need to pay you for spitting out buzzwords pre-scripted. We need to pay for action and critical thinking, not running around like a sheep.

I’m the real deal.

## **You Want Authenticity? You’re Looking at It.**

When I speak, it won’t be pre-packaged, sanitized, or scripted. I don’t care if you’re far right, far left, or in the middle. I don’t care. What you’ll get from me are real, data-driven, common-sense answers.

Here’s the truth:

Everyone in this community wants the same things—we just speak different languages.

-   We want a **better life**.
-   We want what we’ve **earned**.
-   We don’t want **handouts**,
-   but we do care about **people who need a lift**.

**We want that support vetted, audited, and spent where it belongs.**

## **Our Values Aren’t the Problem. The Noise Is.**

I believe everyone has passion. I believe everyone has empathy. I believe in getting results. The problem isn’t what we stand for, it’s how we express it.

That’s where the division starts.

## **You Want a Leader? Here’s What I’ll Do.**

Vote for me because I stand for being **real, pragmatic, and relentless**. I’ll work hard so everyone can rise up.

-   No cookie-cutter responses.
-   No canned statements.
-   No “yes-man” politics.

My process is simple:

-   **Find out what my constituents want.**
-   **Identify what they don’t know and help them understand.**
-   **Learn what I don’t know and educate myself.**
-   **Dig deep, analyze the data, and make the right decisions.**
-   **Act quickly, efficiently, and boldly.**

## **We Can Cut the Waste Without Cutting People Down.**

We can *rip off the band-aid*, but we’re not here to burn the house down in the process. We need real solutions, not just slogans.

**Equality isn’t about lowering standards; it’s about lifting people up.**

## **This Is Our Fight.**

The middle class is strong. We fight for what we’ve earned. We don’t hate the poor. We don’t want division. We want to **rise together** effectively, meaningfully, and without waste.

-   This is our community.
-   And I believe in it.
-   **No fluff. No nonsense. No bull.**

## **You Want Real Change? You Want a Leader?**

If you want a leader, not another **cut-and-paste politician**. Not a **yes-man**.

Then **vote for me, Mark Gingrass**

## **Sheri Biggs, I’m taking your job.**

Step by step, we’re making a difference. Whether it’s me or someone else along the way, we’re working our way up—and we’re not stopping until we take your job.
