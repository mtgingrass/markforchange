# My Book Recommendations

My bookshelf reflects my curiosity. I choose many books that explore history, politics, philosophy, and the human condition. These arenâ€™t just passive reads; they challenge me to think deeply, question assumptions, and connect dots between seemingly unrelated ideas.The more I read, the more connectoins I make.

I'll try to keep up with the books I have read and add them here. The links are Amazon Affiliate links and I make a tiny commission if you choose to purchse one at no cost to you. This helps keep me motivated to update this site.
